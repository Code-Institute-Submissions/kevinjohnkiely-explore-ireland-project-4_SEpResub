# Explore Ireland

This Python & Django application is a tourism based memory sharing platform, designed to allow users to share their experiences of "The Emerald Isle". Users can upload their photos of locations and describe their experience with text and location information. Other users can also comment and like on these pictures, as well as upload their own images into the main homepage feed.

It is intended to be a promotional tool for tourism in Ireland, highlighting some of the superb attractions available here, and also serve as an engaging discussion utility for users who wish to converse on their own and other users favourite locations and memories of Ireland.
